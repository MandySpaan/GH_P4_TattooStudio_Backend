## Assignment üìù

GeeksHub gave the following fictive assignment: The product department has tasked us with developing the backend
corresponding to the appointment management system for a tattoo studio.

**Appointment management for a tattoo studio**: Users will be able to register in the application, log in and access their personal area. Within their area, they will be able to view a list of scheduled appointments for tattoo and piercing services, as well as create new appointments for various services offered by the studio.

## Deploy üí´

Deploy via Zeabur: [ghtattooshop.zeabur.app](https://ghtattooshop.zeabur.app/) <br>

## Points of Improvement üí°

Throughout the project you can find several "ToDo"-comments here and there. These are either thoughts I had myself for extra functionalities or extra options (but not requirements) to add as suggested by the original assignment.
